**Last Updated: September 6, 2025**

## Introduction
Welcome to **NyanTV**, a multiservice tracking client designed exclusively for managing and tracking anime, manga, novels, movies, and series through integration with the official APIs of **AniList**, **MyAnimeList (MAL)**, and **Simkl**. These Terms of Service ("ToS") and Disclaimer govern your use of NyanTV. By using NyanTV, you agree to comply with these terms and conditions. If you disagree, please do not use the app.

NyanTV is developed and maintained by hoemotion ("the Developer"). This document outlines the scope of NyanTV's functionality, user responsibilities, and disclaimers regarding third-party services and content.

## Scope of NyanTV
NyanTV is a client application designed solely for tracking anime by connecting to the official API of AniList. It provides a user interface to access, view, and manage your tracking data hosted by this third-party service.

**NyanTV does not:**
- Host, provide, distribute, maintain, endorse, or facilitate access to any streaming content, media, or third-party extensions, including but not limited to content from licensed providers such as **Crunchyroll**, **Funimation**, **Netflix**, **Hulu**, **HIDIVE**, or any other streaming platforms.
- Store, collect, or process personal information beyond what is required for authentication with supported third-party service (AniList).
- Facilitate, manage, or promote access to any content, repositories, modules, or extensions outside the official API of AniList.

NyanTV is strictly a tracking tool and does not provide or enable access to any copyrighted material or streaming services. Any interaction with licensed content must be conducted through legitimate platforms like Crunchyroll, Funimation, Netflix, Hulu, HIDIVE, or other authorized providers, in compliance with their terms of service.

## User Responsibilities
By using NyanTV, you agree to:
- Use the app solely for its intended purpose of tracking anime via official integration with AniList.
- Comply with the terms of service, privacy policies, and API usage guidelines of AniList, as well as the terms of service of any licensed streaming platforms (e.g., Crunchyroll, Funimation, Netflix, Hulu, HIDIVE) you access independently.
- Be solely responsible for your use of the app, including any interactions with third-party services, repositories, modules, or content accessed outside of NyanTV.
- Ensure your use of NyanTV and any third-party services complies with all applicable local, national, and international laws, including copyright, intellectual property, and Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) regulations.

You acknowledge that:
- NyanTV is a tool for interacting with the official API of AniList and you are responsible for all activity associated with your accounts on these services.
- Any misuse of NyanTV, including unauthorized access to content, use of third-party extensions, repositories, or modules, is your sole responsibility. The Developer disclaims all liability for such actions or any resulting legal issues, including DMCA claims.
- Any legal concerns, including DMCA claims, related to content accessed through third-party services, repositories, or modules must be directed to those services or their respective creators, not NyanTV or the Developer.

## DMCA Compliance
NyanTV is designed to be fully compliant with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and other applicable copyright laws. As a tracking tool, NyanTV does not host, distribute, or provide access to any copyrighted content. Any content accessed by users must be obtained through legitimate, licensed platforms such as Crunchyroll, Funimation, Netflix, Hulu, HIDIVE, or other authorized providers. If you believe that any content accessed through third-party services, repositories, or modules violates your copyright, please direct DMCA notices or legal inquiries to the respective service providers or content hosts, not NyanTV or the Developer. NyanTV does not control, endorse, or facilitate access to such content.

## Privacy Statement
NyanTV prioritizes your privacy and does not collect or store personal information on our servers. Here's how your data is handled:
- **Authentication Tokens**: NyanTV uses authentication tokens to connect to AniList API for tracking functionality. These tokens are stored securely on your device only and are never transmitted to or stored on our servers.

  - [AniList Privacy Policy](https://anilist.co/terms)
- **No Interaction with Streaming Platforms**: NyanTV does not integrate with or store data related to streaming platforms like Crunchyroll, Funimation, Netflix, Hulu, or HIDIVE. Any interaction with these platforms is outside the scope of NyanTV and subject to their respective privacy policies.
- **Crash Reports and Analytics**: NyanTV does not collect crash reports or analytics data. If this changes in the future, we will update this document and provide options to opt out where applicable.

We implement industry-standard security measures to ensure authentication tokens are stored securely on your device. NyanTV does not sell, share, or transfer your information to third parties, except as required by law or to facilitate core tracking functionality through the integrated services.
